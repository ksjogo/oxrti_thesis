The current version (1.2) of the {PTM} specification was published in November 2001. The special characteristic of the {PTM} file format is that with a special viewer, the image can be adjusted on screen by a user to show an object lit from varying directions. This makes the formats very useful for studying objects that are relatively flat, but with an uneven surface. Examples of objects for which interactive viewing using {PTM} images has been particularly valuable include cuneiform tablets, fossils, coins, and the Antikythera mechanism. The images are sometimes described as 2D+.},

The 3D representation achieved by the polynomial texture map ({PTM}) is compared with the extraction of normals from the same image set by photometric stereo. It is shown that the median of each of the X,Y,Z distributions of normal components for a large number of 3-light combinations is a good estimator of the true normal at each point. Using an incised Egyptian stone tablet, normals derived from these two techniques are compared with those generated by a 3D laser scanner. It is shown that the photometric stereo method produces the highest quality rendering of the surface.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a new form of texture mapping that produces increased photorealism. Coefficients of a biquadratic polynomial are stored per texel, and used to reconstruct the surface color under varying lighting conditions. Like bump mapping, this allows the perception of surface deformations. However, our method is image based, and photographs of a surface under varying lighting conditions can be used to construct these maps. Unlike bump maps, these Polynomial Texture Maps ({PTMs}) also capture variations due to surface self-shadowing and interreflections, which enhance realism. Surface colors can be efficiently reconstructed from polynomial coefficients and light directions with minimal fixed-point hardware. We have also found {PTMs} useful for producing a number of other effects such as anisotropic and Fresnel shading models and variable depth of focus. Lastly, we present several reflectance function transformations that act as contrast enhancement operators. We have found these particularly useful in the study of ancient archeological clay and stone writings.},
