The current version (1.2) of the {PTM} specification was published in November 2001. The special characteristic of the {PTM} file format is that with a special viewer, the image can be adjusted on screen by a user to show an object lit from varying directions. This makes the formats very useful for studying objects that are relatively flat, but with an uneven surface. Examples of objects for which interactive viewing using {PTM} images has been particularly valuable include cuneiform tablets, fossils, coins, and the Antikythera mechanism. The images are sometimes described as 2D+.},
