\begin{abstract}
  This project presents a new web-based Reflectance Transformation Imaging
  (RTI) viewer. This project will also explore that software's potential in
  practical applications, such as in the study of historical objects. It is
  based on a novel plugin structure, allowing easy extension by third parties. Additionally included is a new
  file format (specification) for RTI images, enabling better compression and web
  compability; and novel viewer functionality like overlays. Fundamentally this
  project was inspired by a desire to improve the experience of users and developers of RTI viewer(s).
